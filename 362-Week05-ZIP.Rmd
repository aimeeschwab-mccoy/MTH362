## Case study: Drinking on campus

A survey was conducted on a dry college campus to explore factors related to drinking behavior:

1. What proportion of students on campus never drink?
2. What factors, such as off campus living and sex, are related to student drinking?
3. It is commonly assumed that males’ alcohol consumption is greater than females’; is this true on this campus?

---
class: inverse

## Case study: Drinking on campus

Answering these questions would be a simple matter if we knew who was and was not a drinker in our sample. Unfortunately, the non-drinkers did not identify themselves as such, so we will need to use the data available with a model that allows us to estimate the proportion of drinkers and non-drinkers.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
#weekendDrinks <- read.csv("~/OneDrive - Creighton University/Fall 2019 Courses/MTH 362 - Statistical Modeling/Class Notes/weekendDrinks.csv")
weekendDrinks <- read.csv("C:/Users/ads67836/OneDrive - Creighton University/MTH 362 - Statistical Modeling/Class Notes/weekendDrinks.csv")
```

## Case study: Drinking on campus

- Data was provided by students taking an introductory statistics course at St. Olaf College
- Response variable is the students' report of the number of alcoholic drinks they consumed the previous weekend
- Explanatory variables are whether the student lives off campus, and sex

```{r}
head(weekendDrinks)
```

---
class: inverse

## How many drinks consumed?

```{r}
weekendDrinks %>% ggplot(aes(x=drinks)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill='#66c2a5', col='black') +
  labs(x='Drinks Consumed Last Weekend', y='Count')
```

---
class: inverse

## Fitting a Poisson model

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
favstats(~drinks, data=weekendDrinks)
```

---
class: inverse

## Poisson, $\lambda$=2.01

```{r}
x <- 0:22
probs <- dpois(x, lambda=2.01)

prob_dist <- tibble(x, probs)
head(prob_dist)
```

---
class: inverse

## Poisson, $\lambda$=2.01

```{r}
prob_dist %>% ggplot(aes(x=x, y=probs)) + 
  geom_col(fill='#fc8d62', col='black') + 
  labs(x='x', y='P(X=x)', title='Poisson(lambda=2.01)')
```

---
class: inverse

## Poisson, $\lambda$=2.01

```{r}
weekendDrinks %>% ggplot(aes(x=drinks)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill='#66c2a5', col='black') +
  labs(x='Drinks Consumed Last Weekend', y='Count')
```

---

## Problems

1. The data clearly does not match a Poisson distribution with $\lambda$=2.01.
2. There also appears to be some overdispersion:

- $\bar{x}=2.01$
- $SD = 3.28$

Where is the overdispersion coming from?

--

There are __too many zeros__!

---

## Abundance of zeros

We might be able to account for the _abundance of zeros_ with our other variables:

- Who are the non-drinkers?

--

- Does gender play a role?

--

- Can we find out anything about the dorms?

---
class: inverse

## Who are the non-drinkers?

__Assumption__: we believe that those responding zero drinks are coming from a _mixture_ of non-drinkers and drinkers who abstained the weekend of the survey.

--

- __Non-drinkers__: respondents who never drink and would always reply with zero

--

- __Drinkers__: obviously this includes those responding with one or more drinks, but it also includes people who are drinkers but did not happen to imbibe the past weekend. These people reply zero but are not considered non-drinkers.

## Does gender play a role?

Does the distribution of drinks consumed change depending on gender?

```{r, echo=FALSE}

  facet_wrap(~sex) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette='Set2')

## Zero-inflated model

Our explanatory variables don't seem to adequately explain the number of zeros in the data set! What can we do?

--

Build a __zero-inflated Poisson regression model__ to take non-drinkers into account:

- One part models the association, among drinkers, between number of drinks and the predictors.
- The other part uses a predictor for first-year status to obtain an estimate of the proportion of non-drinkers based on the reported zeros.

---

## Zero-inflated model

$$log(\lambda) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X_1) + \beta_2(X_2)$$

- $X_1 =$ `off-campus`
- $X_2 =$ `sex`

--

$$logit(\alpha) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_3$$

- $X_3 =$ `firstyear`

---

## Zero-inflated model

$\alpha$ represents the probability of being in the non-drinkers group

$$logit(\alpha) = log \left( \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} \right)$$

---

## Mixture model

Zero-inflated models are examples of __mixture models__:

- Observations for one or more groups occur together, and group membership is unknown (_latent variable_)

__Example__: Suppose that, unknown to us, half of the students in our sample are non-drinkers, and the other half follow a $Poisson(\lambda=3)$ distribution. What would this mixture model look like?
